Error handling:
 - Add error handling to all API requests
    - For failures of critical API requests, raise exception
    - For failures of recoverable API requests, try again
    - For failures of loops API request, skip over to next iteration
 - Make sure code finishes correctly after exceptions (no files left behind, premature modification of metadata file, resource unlocked, etc.)

tobmp
 - Support 1bpp for low resolution images to make them higher resolution (as B&S won't upload images smaller than 256x256)

Misc
 - Send messages to stdout to convey progress of command

Uncertain
 - Create exploitUpdate for modifying uploads, or should exploitUpload replace if already exists?
 - If upload file is a single zip file, skip the archive step? what about for files too small or too large?
 - Compute hashes using 7z, verify and store in metadata?
