Error handling:
 - Add error handling to all API requests
    - For failures of critical API requests, raise exception
    - For failures of recoverable API requests, try again
    - For failures of loops API request, skip over to next iteration
 - Make sure code finishes correctly after exceptions (no files left behind, premature modification of metadata file, resource unlocked, etc.)

tobmp
 - Support 1bpp for low resolution images to make them higher resolution (as B&S won't upload images smaller than 256x256)

Misc
 - Send messages to stdout to convey progress of command
 - Add readme
 - Find out why stdout is only sent when a newline character is displayed
    (when executing binary, from pyinstaller, in PowerShell the shell only displays the stdout buffer when a newline is sent)
    There are times when this is not ideal (for example when waiting we would like the buffer to be sent with each '.' to keep
    the user updated. Otherwise the '.' get sent all in one go AFTER the waiting is finished
 - Combine drive.picke, credentials.json and config.json into one file
    - Make sure we can save credentials.json and drive.pickle safely

Uncertain
 - Create exploitUpdate for modifying uploads, or should exploitUpload replace if already exists?
 - If upload file is a single zip file, skip the archive step? what about for files too small or too large?
 - Compute hashes using 7z, verify and store in metadata?
 - Create a function to extract individual subfiles/subfolders from images
