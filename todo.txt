Fixes:
 - Add resource lock to .metadata file in Drive

Error handling:
 - Add error handling to all API requests
 - Make sure code finishes correctly after exceptions (no files left behind, premature modification of metadata file, etc)

Metadata
 - Store .metadata as google document so it does not count towards users storage
 - Add .metadata and images to same Drive directory

tobmp
 - Use 1bpp for low resolution images to make them higher resolution (as B&S won't upload images smaller than 256x256)

Misc
 - Create exploitUpdate for modifying uploads?
 - Add -h option functionality


Uncertain
 - Incorporate tobmp within github project?
 - If upload file is a single zip file, skip the archive step? what about for files too small or too large?



Use file hash during upload and download to confirm file integrity
