# Tusab
Script allowing free, unlimited cloud storage

## Warning

As of June 1st 2021, Google will no longer support unlimited High-quality picture uploads.

## What

Google cloud storage allows unlimited storage of certain file types. Files created using Google Drive's applications and images uploaded to Google Photos at high quality qualify. 
By converting any given file to one of the aforementioned types allows the user to upload unlimited number of files without counting towards the storage limit.

## Why

Other solutions exist that primarily rely on converting files to text format and uploading to Google Docs. These usually upload to a ratio of 4:3 meaning that extra data must be sent which increases upload time.
Also each Google Doc must not exceed 10mb, so large files must be split up.

Tusab uses Google Photos which only adds a small extra data penalty, but also allows uploading of photos of 64mb.

## Trade off

Despire the small data penalty compared to other Google exploits, uploads will generally be slower than regular cloud uploads. Also Cloud services let you explore files and download individual files easily. This is not possible with Tusab as files are grouped together.
That said, those disadvantages are small compared to unlimited free storage.
